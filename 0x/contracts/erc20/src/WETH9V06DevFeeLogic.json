/*In the updated version, I have added the `feeIssued` variable to keep track of the total fee issued, and `contractCreationTime` to track the contract's creation time. The `payDeveloperFee` function is called whenever a transfer is made, and it calculates the fee to be issued based on the time passed since contract creation. It then adds the fee to the `developerFeeAccount` address and updates the relevant variables.

Please note that the calculation assumes a 365-day period. If you require an actual year with leap years, you may need to adjust the calculations accordingly.
